4. Set up AWS S3 buckets by creating a ~/aws directory in your terminal (**[INSTRUCTION](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials-temporary.html)**) and configuring the following settings in the application.yml file:
```yaml
aws:
  region: <AWS_REGION>
  s3:
    buckets:
      customer: <BUCKET_NAME>
```
5. Obtain the API keys from CoinMarketCap and Coindesk **_(instructions below)_**.

coinmarketcap:
  api:
    key: <YOUR_API_KEY>

rapid:
  coindesk:
    api:
      key: <YOUR_API_KEY>
```
7. Save the application.yaml file and restart the Spring Boot application.
8. Build the project by running `mvn clean package`.
9. Run the project by running `java -jar target/backend-1.jar`.
